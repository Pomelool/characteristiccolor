If you have a child with a red personality, you need to counteract the intensity with a calm, centered approach. Try to be to-the- point when interacting with your child. They think fast and act fast and will often lose interest and be annoyed and impatient with long drawn out conversations and roud-a- bout lectures. If you have a red personality yourself, you may find it very challenging to deal with your child and will likely have to battle your own impatience and passion when a situation arises. This child is highly motivated, so find what motivates them and watch the magic happen! They may need time to cool off regularly and it is important to work continuously on empathy with them.
